I came upon the Dining Philosophers problem earlier today and for whatever reason wanted to experiment with a few solutions.  Since it's a problem often taught in programming classes, it seemed natural to explore it using programming, so I started making a version of the problem that you could try to solve in javascript, and watch it play out in real time.
